# The Message: Thank You

- **EnderECM:** The main thing for me is that: The ending is going to be a thank you video with us + mod team + Katie friends + some members that we call to record
- **Melkor:** Hm, mainly - it is a sort of us thanking her for creating a place that we can feel welcome and safe, for staying here and not giving up on herself and wishing her to achieve all her wishes

Ask mods about travel plans.
