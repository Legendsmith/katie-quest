name="2D vertices and bone weights swapper"
description="This plugin helps you to enhance the construction speed for your 2D characters that uses Skeleton2D and Polygon2D, by swapping horizontally or vertically the vertex distribution, as well as copying, moving or even swapping the assigned bone weights for those exact same vertices. In other words, it helps you to fasten the rigging process on limbs or simmilar textures."
